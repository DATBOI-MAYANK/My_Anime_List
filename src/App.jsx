            Captured during an assassination mission, Gabimaru the Hollow is
            sentenced to be executed, but nothing seems to kill him due to his
            superhuman body. Believing his love for his wife to be
            subconsciously keeping him alive, executioner Yamada Asaemon Sagiri
            offers him the chance to be pardoned of all crimes by the Shogunate
            if he finds the elixir of life on Shinsenkyo, a legendary realm
            recently discovered southwest of the Ryukyu Kingdom. After losing
            five expedition teams sent to the island, this time the Shogunate
            sends a group of death row convicts. The convicts are each given a
            Yamada Asaemon executioner, who they must return with in order to
            obtain the pardon.

            substitute Soul Reaper after Rukia Kuchiki sacrifices herself to
            protect him. When Rukia is sentenced to death, Ichigo trains to save

            The world of One Piece is home to humans and diverse races,
            including giants, merfolk, fish-men, and the Mink tribe. It is
            governed by the World Government, which controls the Navy to combat
            pirates and Cipher Pol as its secret police. Opposing them is the
            Revolutionary Army, seeking to overthrow their rule. The series
            explores moral ambiguity in piracy, portraying both villains and
            rebels against authoritarian control. Supernatural elements include
            Devil Fruits, granting abilities at the cost of swimming, and Haki,
            enhancing willpower and combat skills, making it one of the few ways
            to counter Devil Fruit users.
